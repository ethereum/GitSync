## Background

The Git Sync Project was conceived amid related efforts to ensure that community research & development could continue in the scenario of legal takedowns of Ethereum-related infrastructure by major cloud services. This project aims to demonstrate how Ethereum community repos and issues hosted on GitHub can be easily restored on another similar service, whether commercial of self-hosted.

## Initial repositories

We selected a handful of key repositories from the "ethereum" GitHub organization and community projects. This list is expected to be expanded.

## How to get your project included

Please submit an issue to the main project repo using [these instructions](https://gitsync.ethereum.org/submit) on the project website. We hope to add many more.
